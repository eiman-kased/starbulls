            <dt>Flying Fridays</dt>
            <dd>If you come to StarBulls on a Friday, prepare to be taken on a ride. We completely transform the
                restaurant
                to make it simulate you're in the clouds. With a little imagination, you will be flying to your
                dream location.
                Since the environment incorporates a flying simulation, we figured the food should give you the same
                kind of
                experience. So come in and order a steak which we carved into a plane. Yes, that's right, for $80
                get a place that
                is built by one giant ribeye along with 2 filet mignons, corn, mac&cheese, tomatoes, and a pickle.
                For $5 more
                add on a generous amount of ranch to create snow on the plane. ($80.00)</dd>

            <dt>Seasoned Saturdays</dt>
            <dd>Stop by on Seasoned Saturdays to try our special homemade dry rub wings seasoning. The seasoning is
                a secret
                recipe we keep in a glass bottle where no one will ever think to look. We are proud to be serving
                this kind
                of sauce to our supporters on Saturdays.</br> It's one of those sauces that you'd wanna order a
                seperate gallon
                of dry sauce just for your 6 pieces of wings. Along with the wings we serve the most seasoned fries
                you
                have ever eaten. </br>We are not done yet, adding onto the seasoned family, try our seasoned beer as
                well.
