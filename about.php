		<h3>Company Information</h3>
		<p>We are the StarBulls. The mighty, mighty StarBulls. Everywhere we go, people want to know:
			WHO WE
			ARE! So we tell
			them: WE ARE THE STARBULLS; THE MIGHTY, MIGHTY STARBULLS!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="heritage">
		<h3>Our Heritage</h3>
		<p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name Starbulls was created by one of the founders:
			Will. He came up with this insane concept of a restaurant that serves wings and coffee.
		</p>
		<p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously,
			look at our site! A beauty to say the least.</p>
		<p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication to get this
			company up
			on the server. Hours of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on
			our
			screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the
			founders
			of StarBulls has known from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
			StarBulls we are
			Winners.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="tools">
		<h3>Tools We Used</h3>
		<p>Like any other company, the founders of StarBulls relied on various resources and tools that helped
			them
			get the site up and running! We would like to share these resources/tools with the
			world.
		</p>
		<h3>They are:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bill C.: You may have heard of him. The Man. The Myth. The Legend. If you haven't, then
				maybe StarBulls is not for you!</li>
			<li>Google.com: This one can have you running in circles BUT a lot of questions have been
				answered by our friend Google.</li>
			<li>Last but not least, the founders at StarBulls, relied on one another and other
				classmates.
			</li>
