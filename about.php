				<p>We are the StarBulls. The mighty, mighty StarBulls. </br> Everywhere we go, people want to know:
					WHO WE

				<h3 class="fw-bold">Our Heritage</h3>
				<p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name StarBulls was created by Will,
					one of our founders. Fueled by a continual flow of caffeine and blue cheese, Will opened StarBulls in Febuary of 2021.
				</p>
				<p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously,
					look at our site! A beauty to say the least.
				</p>
				<p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication, caffeine, and chicken wings to get this
					company up on the server. Days of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on
					our screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the
					founders of StarBulls knew from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
					StarBulls we are Winners!

				<h3>Tools We Used</h3>
				<p>Like any other company, the founders of StarBulls rely on various resources and tools to help
					create this site. We want to share our tools and resources with the world!
				</p>
				<h3>They are:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Bill C.: You may have heard of him. The Man. The Myth. The Legend. If you haven't, then
						maybe StarBulls is not for you!</li>
					<li>Google.com: This one can have you running in circles BUT a lot of questions have been
						answered by our friend Google.</li>
					<li>Last but not least, the founders at StarBulls, relied on one another and other
						classmates.
					</li>
