	<div class="company">
		<h3>Company Information</h3>
		<p>We are the StarBulls. The mighty, mighty StarBulls. Everywhere we go, people want to know:
			WHO WE
			ARE! So we tell
			them: WE ARE THE STARBULLS; THE MIGHTY, MIGHTY STARBULLS!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="heritage">
		<h3>Our Heritage</h3>
		<p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name StarBulls was created by Will, one of our founders. Fueled by a continual flow of caffiene and blue cheese, Will opened StarBulls in Febuary of 2021.</p>
		<p>
		<p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously,
			look at our site! A beauty to say the least.
		</p>
		<p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication to get this
			company up on the server. Hours of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on
			our screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the
			founders of StarBulls has known from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
			StarBulls we are Winners.
		</p>

	<div class="tools">
		<h3>Tools We Used</h3>
		<p>Like any other company, the founders of StarBulls relied on various resources and tools that helped
			them get the site up and running! We want to share these resources and tools with the world.
		</p>
		<h3>They are:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bill C.: You may have heard of him. The Man. The Myth. The Legend. If you haven't, then
				maybe StarBulls is not for you!</li>
			<li>Google.com: This one can have you running in circles BUT a lot of questions have been
				answered by our friend Google.</li>
			<li>Last but not least, the founders at StarBulls, relied on one another and other
				classmates.
			</li>
		</ol>
