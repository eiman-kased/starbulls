				<p>We are the StarBulls. The mighty, mighty StarBulls. </br> Everywhere we go, people want to know:
					WHO WE

				<h3 class="fw-bold">Our Heritage</h3>
				<p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name StarBulls was created by Will,
					one of our founders. Fueled by a continual flow of caffeine and blue cheese, Will opened StarBulls in Febuary of 2021.
				</p>
				<p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously,
					look at our site! A beauty to say the least.
				</p>
				<p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication, caffeine, and chicken wings to get this
					company up on the server. Days of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on
					our screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the
					founders of StarBulls knew from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
					StarBulls we are Winners!

<br/>This team did not come together by choice, but our destiny brought us to Starbulls. It was a great privilege and honor to work on this site. Starbulls is the place to be. When you are in town, make sure to try our Wingin’ it Wednesday. It is all you can eat buffet-style WINGS! with a variety of selections to choose from. I invite you to check out my portfolio as I continue to build on more projects.
