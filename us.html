                        <h3>Our Heritage</h3>
                        <p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name Starbulls was created by one
                            of
                            the founders: Will. He came up with this insane concept of a restaurant that serves wings
                            and
                            coffee! </p> </br>
                        <p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously,
                            look
                            at our site! A beauty to say the least.</p>
                        <p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication to get this
                            company up
                            on the server. Hours of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on
                            our
                            screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the
                            founders
                            of StarBulls has known from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
                            StarBulls we are
                            Winners. </p>
