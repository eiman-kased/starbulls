                    <h3>Our Heritage</h3>
                    <p>We are humbled by the success of our company thus far. The name Starbulls was created by one of
                        the founders: Will. He came up with this insane concept of a restaurant that serves wings and
                        coffee! </p> </br>
                    <p>How do we measure success? Simply: we started from the bottom, now we are here! Seriously, look
                        at our site! A beauty to say the least.</p>
                    <p>Just a week ago, StarBulls did not exist. It has taken hours of dedication to get this company up
                        on the server. Hours of frustration, trying to figure out why the code looks different on our
                        screens. Hours of trial and error as we figured out where we went wrong. One thing the founders
                        of StarBulls has known from the beginning is: Quitters Never Win. And Winners Never Quit. At
                        StarBulls we are
                        Winners. </p>
